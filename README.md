# Case study of microclimate network on oak woodlands of Sierra Nevada 

This repo contains some case studies of the microclimate environment of *Quercus pyrenaica* oak woodlands of Sierra Nevada (southern Spain). 

A microclimatic sensors network was deployed in an oak woodland population (*Q. pyrenaica*) located in Cáñar (Alpujarras, Granada), on the south slopes of Sierra Nevada. 

Using data from those sensors we explore some study cases. All analysis included in this repo are preeliminar.
